Autism	autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and verbal and non verbal communication and by restricted repetitive or stereotyped behavior the diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old it is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum asds the other two being asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified commonly abbreviated as pdd nos which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or asperger syndrome are not met autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations or by rare combinations of common genetic variants in rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects controversies surround other proposed environmental causes such as heavy metals pesticides or childhood vaccines the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life the signs usually develop gradually but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress early behavioral cognitive or speech interventions can help autistic children gain self care social and communication skills although there is no known cure there have been reported cases of children who recovered not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder characteristics autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years it is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars three to five year old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums a 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with asd and reported that about two thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one third had a history of aggression with tantrums significantly more common than in non autistic children with language impairments a 2008 swedish study found that of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of asd those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis or reverse pronouns joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language repetitive behavior autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs r categorizes as follows a young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row stereotypy is repetitive movement such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking compulsive behavior is intended and appears to follow rules such as arranging objects in stacks or lines sameness is resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted ritualistic behavior involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors a 2007 study reported that self injury at some point affected about 30 of children with asd no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur deletion 1 duplication 2 and inversion 3 are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified typically autism cannot be traced to a mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variations spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion extensive searches are underway and prenatal stress the latter theory was supported by a litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children pathophysiology autism affects the amygdala cerebellum and many other parts of the brain unlike many other brain disorders such as parkinson s autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following an excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines for example by modulation of the neurexin neuroligin cell adhesion system the mirror neuron system mns theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action the mns may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions this extension is controversial as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects however most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people s basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people icd 10 uses essentially the same definition a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associatedmedical conditions a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions such as landau kleffner syndrome although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40 of cases to genetic causes a genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior according to an article in the journal of autism and developmental disorders failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome no babbling by 12 months no gesturing pointing waving etc by 12 months no single words by 16 months no two word spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by 24 months any loss of any language or social skills at any age us and japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at 18 and 24 months using autism specific formal screening tests in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened it is not known which approach is more effective screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers m chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on m chat and its predecessor chat on children aged 18 30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results and no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not it is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from 3 to 25 few high quality studies address long term prognosis some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife epidemiology reports of autism cases per 1 000 children grew dramatically in the us from 1996 to 2007 it is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in autism s prevalence most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1 2 per 1 000 for autism and close to 6 per 1 000 for asd pdd nos s prevalence has been estimated at 3 7 per 1 000 asperger syndrome at roughly 0 6 per 1 000 and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0 02 per 1 000 a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics boys are at higher risk for asd than girls the sex ratio averages 4 3 1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to 2 1 with mental retardation and more than 5 5 1 without although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism they include genetic disorders about 10 15 of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their autistic children s behaviors are perceived negatively by others and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being
Albedo	percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions albedo or reflection coefficient derived from latin albedo whiteness or reflected sunlight in turn from albus white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface it is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it being a dimensionless fraction it may also be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation when quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light in general the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation exceptions are lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution in practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately although the albedo is a very useful first approximation the albedo is an important concept in climatology and astronomy as well as in calculating reflectivity of surfaces in leed sustainable rating systems for buildings the average overall albedo of earth its planetary albedo is 30 to 35 because of the covering by clouds but varies widely locally across the surface depending on the geological and environmental features the term was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometria terrestrial albedo class wikitable style float right margin 10px sample albedos surface typical albedo fresh asphalt 0 04 conifer forest summer 0 08 deciduous trees 0 15 to 0 18 bare soil 0 17 desert sand 0 40 ocean ice 0 5 0 7 fresh snow 0 80 0 90 albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0 9 for fresh snow to about 0 04 for charcoal one of the darkest substances deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of 0 1 to 0 4 this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds human activities have changed the albedo via forest clearance and farming for example of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult the classic example of albedo effect is the snow temperature feedback if a snow covered area warms and the snow melts the albedo decreases more sunlight is absorbed and the temperature tends to increase the converse is also true if snow forms a cooling cycle happens the intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics 2003 2004 mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo the earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa s modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites as the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite a mathematical model of the brdf is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e g the earth s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 c if the earth was frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below 40 c if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 c in contrast if all the ice on earth were to melt a so called aquaplanet the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 c white sky and black sky albedo it has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle astronomical albedo the albedos of planets satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in asteroids enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with 99 of em radiation reflected another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of 0 96 while such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the v band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is small scale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g siberia were neutral or perhaps warming snow snow albedos can be as high as 0 9 this however is for the ideal example fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape over antarctica they average a little more than 0 8 if a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt the ice albedo positive feedback cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0 8 on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect black carbon another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is 0 2 w m 2 with a range 0 1 to 0 4 w m 2 other types of albedo single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle or particles and the wavelength of the incoming radiation

pronunciation of the letter and the sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel and gave it the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the 8th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet used to write many languages including english typographic variants include a double story a and single story during roman times there were many variations on the letter a first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent mediums for perishable surfaces what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes a cursive style was used due to the perishable nature of the surfaces these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental this perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive semicursive minuscule there were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial at the termination of the roman empire 5th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule appeared through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the 9th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through a combining of prior forms 15th century italy saw the formation of the two variants that are known today these variants the italics and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italics form used in most current handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke called latin alpha or script a this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of dark age irish and english writers most printed material uses the roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form use in english in english the letter a currently represents six different vowel sounds a by itself frequently denotes the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father its original latin and greek sound a closer further fronted sound as in hare which developed as the sound progressed from father to ace in concert with a later orthographic vowel the diphthong as in ace and major due to effects of the great vowel shift the more rounded form in water or its

Alabama	alabama is a state located in the southeastern region of the united states it is bordered by tennessee to the north georgia to the east florida and the gulf of mexico to the south and mississippi to the west alabama is the 30th most extensive and the 23rd most populous of the 50 united states at alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of 1540 with garcilaso de la vega using alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively as early as 1702 the tribe was known to the french as alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivi re des alibamons other spellings of the appellation have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu and allibamou this notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek experts in the muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation scholars believe the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather or herb gatherers or to collecting medicinal plants alabama has a number of place names of native american origin nineteenth century the main house built in 1833 at thornhill in greene county it is a former black belt plantation prior to the admission of mississippi as a state on december 10 1817 the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory the alabama territory was created by the united states congress on march 3 1817 st stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819 southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded the economy of the central black belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew largely from slave labor the area also drew many poor disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers alabama had a population estimated at under 10 000 people in 1810 but it had increased to more than 300 000 people by 1830 most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in 1830 organized resistance groups also tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans besides the short lived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league reconstruction in alabama ended in 1874 when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor s office they wrote another constitution in 1875 and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools more jim crow laws were passed at the beginning of the 20th century to enforce segregation in everyday life twentieth century the developing skyline of birmingham in 1915 the new 1901 constitution of alabama included electoral laws that effectively disfranchised african americans and most poor whites through voting restrictions including poll taxes and literacy requirements in 1900 alabama had more than 181 000 african americans eligible to vote by 1903 only 2 980 had qualified to register although at least 74 000 african american voters were literate by 1941 more white alabamians than african american alabamians had been disfranchised 600 000 whites to 520 000 african americans the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes continued racial discrimination agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans to seek opportunities in northern cities they left alabama in the early 20th century as part of the great migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920 reflecting this emigration at the same time many rural people white and african american moved to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the magic city by the 1920s birmingham was the 19th largest city in the united states and had more than 30 of the alabama s population heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers can be shown by what happened in mobile between 1940 and 1943 more than 89 000 people moved into the city to work for war effort industries african americans were presumed partial to republicans for historical reasons but they were disfranchised white alabamans felt bitter towards the republican party in the aftermath of the civil war and reconstruction these factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a democrat regardless of political beliefs although efforts had already started decades earlier african americans began to more actively attempt to end the disfranchisement and segregation in the state during the 1950s and 1960s with the civil rights movement these efforts directly led to the enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 by the u s congress during the 1960s under governor george wallace failed attempts were made at the state level to resist federally sanctioned desegregation efforts during the civil rights movement african americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national civil rights act of 1964 geography a general map of alabama alabama is the

they move inland and weaken south alabama reports many thunderstorms the gulf coast around mobile bay averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported this activity decreases somewhat further north in the state but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year occasionally thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail the central and

politics robert j bentley governor since january 17 2011 kay ivey lieutenant governor during reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope in 1874 the political coalition known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the african american vote after 1890 a coalition of white politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution provisions which disfranchised african americans also disfranchised poor whites however by 1941 more whites than african americans had been disfranchised 600 000 to 520 000 although the impact was greater on the african american community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from 1901 through the 1960s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972 alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the american civil rights movement when racist whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for

of 1965 did african americans regain suffrage among other civil rights in 2007 the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing profound regret over

Abraham Lincoln	abraham lincoln february 12 1809 april 15 1865 was the 16th president of the united states serving from march 1861 until his assassination in april 1865 lincoln led the united states through its greatest constitutional military and moral crisis the american civil war preserving the union abolishing slavery strengthening the national government and modernizing the economy reared in a poor family on the western frontier lincoln was self educated and became a country lawyer a whig party leader illinois state legislator during the 1830s and a one term member of the united states house of representatives during the 1840s after a series of highly publicized debates in 1858 during which he opposed the expansion of slavery lincoln lost the u s senate race in illinois to his archrival stephen a douglas lincoln a moderate from a swing state secured the republican party presidential nomination in 1860 with almost no support in the south lincoln swept the north and was elected president in 1860 his election was the signal for seven southern slave states to declare their secession from the union and form the confederacy the departure of the southerners gave lincoln s party firm control of congress but no formula for compromise or reconciliation was found lincoln explained in his second inaugural address both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came when the north enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the confederate attack on fort sumter on april 12 1861 lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort his goal was now to reunite the nation he suspended habeas corpus arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists in the border states without trial lincoln averted british recognition of the confederacy by defusing the trent affair in late 1861 his numerous complex moves toward ending slavery centered on the emancipation proclamation in 1863 using the army to protect escaped slaves encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery and helping push through congress the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution which permanently outlawed slavery lincoln closely supervised the war effort especially the selection of top generals including commanding general ulysses s grant lincoln brought leaders of the major factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate lincoln s navy set up a naval blockade that shut down the south s normal trade helped take control of kentucky and tennessee and gained control of the southern river system using gunboats he tried repeatedly to capture the confederate capital at richmond virginia each time a general failed lincoln substituted another until finally grant succeeded in 1865 an exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state lincoln reached out to war democrats and managed his own re election in the 1864 presidential election as the leader of the moderate faction of the republican party lincoln found his policies and personality were blasted from all sides radical republicans demanded harsher treatment of the south war democrats desired more compromise copperheads despised him and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death alt a statue of young lincoln sitting on a stump holding a book open on his lap the family moved north across the ohio river to free i e non slave territory and made a new start in what was then perry county but is now spencer county indiana lincoln later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery but mainly due to land title difficulties congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it the national papers ignored it and it resulted in a loss of political support for lincoln in his district one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases in 51 as sole counsel of which 31 were decided in his favor lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom but in an 1859 case where he defended a cousin peachy harrison who was accused of stabbing another to death lincoln angrily protested the judge s decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as was expected the judge a democrat reversed his ruling allowing the evidence and acquitting harrison in 272 words and three minutes lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as a result of the losses and the future of democracy in the world would be assured that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth lincoln concluded that the civil war had a profound objective a new birth of freedom in the nation in june 1864 lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court noah haynes swayne nominated january 21 1862 and appointed january 24 1862 was chosen as an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the union samuel freeman miller nominated and appointed on july 16 1862 supported lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist david davis lincoln s campaign manager in 1860 nominated december 1 1862 and appointed december 8 1862 had also served as a judge in lincoln s illinois court circuit stephen johnson field a previous california supreme court justice was nominated march 6 1863 and appointed march 10 1863 and provided geographic balance as well as political balance to the court as a democrat finally lincoln s treasury secretary salmon p chase was nominated as chief justice and appointed the same day on december 6 1864 lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party a 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after washington of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since 1948 lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls schlesinger 1948 schlesinger 1962 1982 murray blessing survey chicago tribune 1982 poll schlesinger 1996 cspan 1996 ridings mciver 1996 time 2008 and cspan 2009 generally the top three presidents are rated as 1 lincoln 2 george washington and 3 franklin d roosevelt although lincoln and washington and washington and roosevelt occasionally are reversed president lincoln s assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty republicans linked lincoln s name to their party many though not all in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum focuses on lincoln scholarship and popular interpretation schwartz argues that lincoln s reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the progressive era 1900 1920s when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in american history with even white southerners in agreement the high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the mall in washington in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state in the cold war years lincoln s image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes by the 1970s lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks internal improvements and railroads in opposition to the agrarian democrats william c harris found that lincoln s reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism james g randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders by the late 1960s liberals such as historian lerone bennett were having second thoughts especially regarding lincoln s views on racial issues bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968 he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs told jokes that ridiculed blacks insisted he opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country defenders such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation historian barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincoln s image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late 20th century on the other hand donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in a flattering light memorials lincoln memorial in washington d c lincoln s portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency the penny and the 5 bill his likeness also appears on many postage stamps and has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the capital of nebraska the most famous and most visited memorials are the lincoln memorial in washington d c lincoln s sculpture on mount rushmore ford s theatre and petersen house where he died in washington and the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum located in springfield illinois not far from lincoln s home and his tomb barry schwartz a sociologist who has examined america s cultural memory argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life during the great depression he argues lincoln served as a means for seeing the world s disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful franklin d roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan americans asked what would lincoln do however he also finds that since world war ii lincoln s symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept bibliography cited in footnotes also

Aristotle	aristotle aristot l s 384 bc 322 bc by 335 bc he had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him a son whom he named after his father nicomachus according to the suda he also had an eromenos palaephatus of abydus aristotle wrote many dialogues only fragments of which survived the works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics de anima on the soul and poetics aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time but made significant contributions to most of them in physical science aristotle studied anatomy astronomy embryology geography geology meteorology physics and zoology in philosophy he wrote on aesthetics ethics government metaphysics politics economics psychology rhetoric and theology he also studied education foreign customs literature and poetry his combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of greek knowledge it has been suggested that aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time aristotle s scientific method plato left and aristotle right a detail of the school of athens a fresco by raphael aristotle gestures to the earth representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience while holding a copy of his nicomachean ethics in his hand whilst plato gestures to the heavens representing his belief in the forms aristotle by francesco hayez 1791 1882 like his teacher plato aristotle s philosophy aims at the universal aristotle however finds the universal in particular things which he calls the essence of things while plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar for aristotle therefore philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences while for plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal forms or ideas to a contemplation of particular imitations of these for aristotle form still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is instantiated in a particular substance see universals and particulars below in a certain sense aristotle s method is both inductive and deductive while plato s is essentially deductive from a priori principles aristotle s history of animals classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical ladder of life scala naturae placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move aristotle believed that intellectual purposes i e final causes guided all natural processes such a teleological view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design noting that no animal has at the same time both tusks and horns and a single hooved animal with two horns i have never seen aristotle suggested that nature giving no animal both horns and tusks was staving off vanity and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter with nature trying to preserve a type of balance in a similar fashion aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man the scala naturae or great chain of being his system had eleven grades arranged according to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality expressed in their form at birth the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive the lowest bore theirs cold dry and in thick eggs aristotle also held that the level of a creature s perfection was reflected in its form but not preordained by that form ideas like this and his ideas about souls are not regarded as science at all in modern times he placed emphasis on the type s of soul an organism possessed asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul responsible for reproduction and growth animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul responsible for mobility and sensation and humans a vegetative a sensitive and a rational soul capable of thought and reflection aristotle in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotle s division of sensation and thought which generally went against previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon successor theophrastus the frontispiece to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of historia plantarum ca 1200 which was originally written around 200 bc aristotle s successor at the lyceum theophrastus wrote a series of books on botany the history of plants which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany even into the middle ages many of theophrastus names survive into modern times such as carpos for fruit and pericarpion for seed vessel rather than focus on formal causes as aristotle did theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes and relying on aristotle s concept of the efficient cause theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants though this last discovery was lost in later ages influence on hellenistic medicine after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotle s ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries ernst mayr claimed that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance aristotle s ideas of natural history and medicine survived but they were generally taken unquestioningly psychology aristotle s psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psyche often known by its latin title de anima posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have a rational soul this kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them for aristotle the soul psyche was a simpler concept than it is for us today by soul he simply meant the form of a living being since all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings e g the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement practical philosophy ethics aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study i e one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of a thing an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuch normally translated as soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character thik aret often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher politics like aristotle conservatives generally accept the world as it is they distrust the politics of abstract reason that is reason divorced from experience benjamin wiker rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication the authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally aristotelian is also today held suspect with some books duplicating or summarizing each other the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely aristotle s at all some of the individual works within the corpus including the constitution of athens are regarded by most scholars as products of aristotle s school perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision others such as on colors may have been produced by aristotle s successors at the lyceum e g theophrastus and straton still others acquired aristotle s name through similarities in doctrine or content such as the de plantis possibly by nicolaus of damascus other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to aristotle are purely fanciful and self promotional however some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that cicero s praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in aristotle s extant works later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotle s work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotle s notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion meno mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotle s influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle s geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all men s common property influence on western christian theologians with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from c ad 600 to c 1100 except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after thomas aquinas wrote his theology working from moerbeke s translations the demand for aristotle s writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance aristotle is referred to as the philosopher by scholastic thinkers such as thomas aquinas see summa theologica part i question 3 etc these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having at his beddes heed twenty bookes clad in blak or reed of aristotle and his philosophie the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the first circles of hell i saw the master there of those who know amid the philosophic family by all admired and by all reverenced there plato too i saw and socrates who stood beside him closer than the rest vidi l maestro di color che sanno seder tra filosofica famiglia tutti lo miran tutti onor li fanno quivi vid o socrate e platone che nnanzi a li altri pi presso li stanno dante l inferno hell canto iv lines 131 135 post enlightenment thinkers the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle however implausible this is it is certainly the case that aristotle s rigid separation of action from production and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue or arete of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy it is martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition ayn rand accredited aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as a major influence on her thinking more recently alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans list of works the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum these texts as opposed to aristotle s lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle s school reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekker s royal prussian academy edition aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica berlin 1831 1870 which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works honours aristotle mountains on oscar ii coast in graham land antarctica are named after aristotle who was the first to conjecture the existence of a landmass in the southern high latitude region calling it antarctica notes and references
An American in Paris	a theme from george gershwin s orchestral composition an american in paris an american in paris is a symphonic tone poem by the american composer george gershwin written in 1928 inspired by the time gershwin had spent in paris it evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the 1920s and is one of his best known compositions gershwin composed an american in paris on commission from the new york philharmonic he scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns he brought back some parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december 13 1928 in carnegie hall with walter damrosch conducting the new york symphony gershwin completed the orchestration on november 18 less than four weeks before the work s premiere gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer deems taylor noting that my purpose here is to portray the impression of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere when the tone poem moves into the blues our american friend has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness but nostalgia is not a fatal disease the american visitor once again is an alert spectator of parisian life and the street noises and french atmosphere are triumphant background maurice ravel met gershwin in new york during ravel s tour of the united states in that meeting gershwin asked ravel to be his teacher to which ravel responded that it was better to be a first rate gershwin than a second rate ravel instead ravel recommended that gershwin see nadia boulanger in paris ravel s high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking time to study abroad in paris gershwin arrived in paris in march 1928 paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound w b yeats ernest hemingway and artist pablo picasso gershwin met with boulanger and at her request he played ten minutes of his music boulanger replied that she had nothing to teach him this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue composition gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called very parisienne written in 1926 on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer he described the piece as a rhapsodic ballet because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose aba format gershwin s first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six this a section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns the b section s andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve bar blues in the b section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum moderato con grazia is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final grandioso instrumentation an american in paris is scored for 3 flutes 3rd doubling on piccolo 2 oboes english horn 2 clarinets in b flat bass clarinet in b flat 2 bassoons 4 horns in f 3 trumpets in b flat 3 trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block cymbals low and high tom toms xylophone glockenspiel celesta 4 taxi horns resembling the pitches a b c and d alto saxophone soprano saxophone tenor saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone baritone saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone and strings the revised edition by f campbell watson calls for three saxophones alto tenor and baritone in this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments william daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by new world music in 1929 response gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch s interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris he stated that damrosch s sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work the audience according to edward cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than his lukewarm concerto in f some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers c sar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere gershwin responded to the critics it s not a beethoven symphony you know it s a humorous piece nothing solemn about it it s not intended to draw tears if it pleases symphony audiences as a light jolly piece a series of impressions musically expressed it succeeds recordings first recording an american in paris has been frequently recorded the first recording was made for rca victor in 1929 with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio then a little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording the radio broadcast of the september 8 1937 hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert in which an american in paris also conducted by shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two cd set arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music in 1945 arturo toscanini and the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the music in carnegie hall one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer the seattle symphony also recorded a version in the 1980s of gershwin s original score before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today use in film in 1951 mgm released the musical an american in paris featuring gene kelly and leslie caron winning the 1951 best picture oscar and numerous other awards the film was directed by vincente minnelli featured many tunes of gershwin and concluded with an extensive elaborate dance sequence built around the an american in paris symphonic poem arranged for the film by johnny green costing 500 000 a part of the symphonic composition is also featured in as good as it gets released in 1997

Academy Award	the academy awards now officially known as the oscars this method was used until the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years for example the 2nd academy awards presented on 3 april 1930 recognized films that were released between 1 august 1928 and 31 july 1929 starting with the 7th academy awards held in 1935 the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from 1 january to 31 december the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first academy award winner in history the honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films since the fourth ceremony the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film a total of 2 894 oscars have been given for 1 853 awards a total of 302 actors have won oscars in competitive acting categories or have been awarded honorary or juvenile awards the 1939 film beau geste is the only movie starring as many as four academy award winners for best actor or best actress in a leading role gary cooper ray milland susan hayward broderick crawford prior to any of the actors receiving the best actor award at the 29th ceremony held on 27 march 1957 the best foreign language film category was introduced until then foreign language films were honored with the special achievement award oscar statuette official name academy award of merit height 13 inches weight 8 pounds number of awards presented 2 809 first recipient emil jannings named best actor for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh in 1929 design a knight holding a crusader s sword standing on a reel of film the film reel features five spokes signifying the five original branches of the academy actors directors producers technicians and writers designer cedric gibbons chief art director at metro goldwyn mayer sculptor los angeles artist george stanley manufacturer r s owens company in chicago manufacturing time 3 4 weeks for 50 statuettes design although there are eight other types of annual awards presented by the academy the irving g thalberg memorial award the jean hersholt humanitarian award the gordon e sawyer award the academy scientific and technical award the academy award for technical achievement the john a bonner medal of commendation and the student academy award plus two awards that are not presented annually the special achievement award in the form of an oscar statuette and the honorary award that may or may not be in the form of an oscar statuette the best known one is the academy award of merit more popularly known as the oscar statuette made of gold plated britannium on a black metal base it is 13 5 in 34 cm tall weighs 8 5 lb 3 85 kg and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a crusader s sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy actors writers directors producers and technicians in 1928 mgm s art director cedric gibbons one of the original academy members supervised the design of the award trophy by printing the design on a scroll in need of a model for his statuette gibbons was introduced by his future wife dolores del r o to mexican film director and actor emilio el indio fern ndez reluctant at first fern ndez was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the oscar then sculptor george stanley who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl sculpted gibbons s design in clay and sachin smith cast the statuette in 92 5 percent tin and 7 5 percent copper and then gold plated it the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base the original oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the c w shumway sons foundry in batavia illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy awards statuettes since 1983 approximately 50 oscars are made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer r s owens company in support of the american effort in world war ii the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended naming the origin of the name oscar is disputed one biography of bette davis claims that she named the oscar after her first husband band leader harmon oscar nelson one of the earliest mentions in print of the term oscar dates back to a time magazine article about the 1934 6th academy awards walt disney is also quoted as thanking the academy for his oscar as early as 1932 another claimed origin is that the academy s executive secretary margaret herrick first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette s reminding her of her uncle oscar a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce columnist sidney skolsky was present during herrick s naming and seized the name in his byline employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette oscar the trophy was officially dubbed the oscar in 1939 by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences it may also have been named after the famous irish playwright oscar wilde ownership of oscar statuettes since 1950 the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the academy for us 1 if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the academy keeps the statuette academy awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six figure sums in december 2011 orson welles 1941 oscar for citizen kane best original screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy on 20 december 2011 it sold in an online auction for us 861 542 while the oscar is owned by the recipient it is essentially not on the open market michael todd s grandson tried to sell todd s oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989 but the academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction although some oscar sales transactions have been successful some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy which keeps them in its treasury nomination since 2004 academy award nomination results have been announced to the public in late january prior to that the results were announced in early february voters the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ampas a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of 5 783 academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering 1 311 members 22 percent of the academy s composition votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and its predecessor price waterhouse for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors on behalf of academy branch executive committees membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures new membership proposals are considered annually the academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join the 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6 000 voting members while the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then in may 2011 the academy sent a letter advising its 6 000 or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting will be implemented in 2013 rules according to rules 2 and 3 of the official academy awards rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of 1 january to midnight at the end of 31 december in los angeles county california to qualify except for the best foreign language film for example the 2009 best picture winner the hurt locker was actually first released in 2008 but did not qualify for the 2008 awards as it did not play its oscar qualifying run in los angeles until mid 2009 thus qualifying for the 2009 awards rule 2 states that a film must be feature length defined as a minimum of 40 minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frame s or 48 frame s progressive scan digital cinema format with native resolution not less than 1280x720 producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year the form includes the production credits for all related categories then each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around 6000 active members for most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories i e only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc there are some exceptions in the case of certain categories like foreign film documentary and animated feature film in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches in the special case of best picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category foreign films must include english subtitles and each country can submit only one film per year the members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for best picture the winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories including best picture ceremony telecast 31st academy awards presentations pantages theater hollywood 1959 81st academy awards presentations dolby theatre hollywood 2009 the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony most commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow tie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast the academy awards is televised live across the united states excluding hawaii they aired live in alaska starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996 canada the united kingdom and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world the 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million americans other awards ceremonies such as the emmys golden globes and grammys are broadcast live in the east coast but are on tape delay in the west coast and might not air on the same day outside north america if the awards are even televised the academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources the awards show was first televised in 1953 on nbc which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the abc network took over televising the festivities through 1970 after which nbc resumed the broadcasts abc once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 and it is under contract to do so through the year 2020 after more than 60 years of being held in late march or early april the ceremonies were moved up to late february or early march starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success of the ncaa men s division i basketball championship which would cut into the academy awards audience the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period some years the ceremony is moved into early march in deference to the winter olympics advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast the awards show holds the distinction of having won the most emmys in history with 47 wins and 195 nominations after many years of being held on mondays at 9 00 pm eastern 6 00 p m pacific in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to sundays at 8 30 pm eastern 5 30 pm pacific the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier for many years the film industry had opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office on 30 march 1981 the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington d c in 1993 an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names in 2010 the organizers of the academy awards announced that winners acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion the academy has also had recent discussions about moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industry s long awards season but such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail also a january ceremony may have to compete

best picture trophy more than 57 25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th academy awards in 1998 the year of titanic which generated close to us 600 million at the north american box office pre oscars tim dirks editor of amc s filmsite org has written of the academy awards unfortunately the critical worth artistic vision cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight especially since the 1980s moneymaking formula made blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd pleasing titans and best picture winners but they haven t necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the usa the last 3 months of the calendar year this has led to the coining of the term oscar bait describing such movies overall the academy appears to go through periods of rewarding a certain type of film war themed movies in the early 1940s social issue dramas in the late 1940s late 1960s and mid 2000s musicals and historical epics in the early to mid 1960s family melodramas and biographical epics in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s atypical genres movies formerly considered b movies in the early 1970s and 1990s romantic historical epic dramas in the late 1990s and early 2000s independent violent movies from critically acclaimed directors in the late 2000s and xxth century historical movies in the 2010s this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience e g by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues the academy appears to compensate by nominating these movies in other categories e g effects and editing awards for science fiction and action movies screenplay and supporting acting nominations for comedies and directing cinematography and foreign language nominations for critically acclaimed arthouse films acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons personal popularity atonement
